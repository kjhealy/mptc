## The [reprex]{.fg-yellow} package

![](../assets/12-build/12_reprex.png)

## Best demonstrated live

When asking for help, make a [**reproducible example**]{.fg-green}

```{r }
#| label: 08-making-tidy-easier-3
library(reprex)
```



```{r }
#| label: 08-making-tidy-easier-4
library(tidyverse)

  count(homeworld, species) |>
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n) * 100) |>

```

## The `usethis` package

![](../assets/12-build/12_usethis.png)


## `usethis` project workflow

- `create_project()`;
- Also: `create_quarto_project()`; `create_from_github()`
- `use_git()`
- `use_github()`
- `use_data_raw()`; `use_data()`
- `use_readme_rmd()`

Many more specialized functions available too for packages, tests, vignettes,
etc. And also many configuration helpers like `use_git_config()`,
`create_github_token()`, `git_sitrep()`, etc.

# [Tables]{.fg-orange}, [tables]{.fg-yellow}, [tables]{.fg-green}

## tinytable

Very handy for many kinds of table that will cover most use-cases.

```{r}
#| output-location: column

mtcars |>
  tinytable::tt()
```

Be careful to not to over-customize your tables, especially if your output
format is going to vary between HTML and PDF, as some features may not work
equally well (or in the same way) in both formats.

## Sidenote

General rules about tables:

- Edit tables with the same attention given to text, and set them as text to be
read. (And not as a way to cram as much stuff as possible onto a page.)
- All text should be horizontal, or in rare cases oblique.
- Minimize rules, boxes, dots and other guiderails.
information.
- Vertical lines are almost never needed.
- Do not put boxes or borders around table cells.
- Rules, tint blocks or other guides and dividers are, in general, unneccessary.
When needed they should run in the direction of reading.
- Align text (labels) left. (Not centered.)
- Align numbers right. If numbers contain decimals, align on the decimal point.


## gt

From its website:

:::: {.smallcode}

```{r}
#| output-location: column

library(gt)

# Define the start and end dates for the data range
start_date <- "2010-06-07"
end_date <- "2010-06-14"

# Create a gt table based on preprocessed
# `sp500` table data
sp500 |>
  dplyr::filter(date >= start_date & date <= end_date) |>
  dplyr::select(-adj_close) |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(
    title = "S&P 500",
    subtitle = glue::glue("{start_date} to {end_date}")
  ) |>

  fmt_date(columns = date, date_style = "wd_m_day_year") |>

## gtsummary

[**`gtsummary()`**]{.fg-green} straight out of the box:

## Summarize with [skimr]{.fg-green}

- We might want to make a [codebook]{.fg-orange} of our data

```{r }
#| label: 08-making-tidy-easier-29
library(skimr)
organdata <- read_csv(here("files", "examples", "organdonation.csv"))

```

## Summarize with [skimr]{.fg-green}

```{r }
#| label: 08-making-tidy-easier-30
organdata |> skim(where(is.numeric)) |> partition()
```

## Summarize with [skimr]{.fg-green}


```{r }
#| label: 08-making-tidy-easier-31
organdata |> skim(!where(is.numeric)) |> partition()
```

## Custom Summaries

```{r}
#| label: 08-making-tidy-easier-32

load(here("files", "examples", "stmf.rda"))

stmf
```

## Custom Summaries

```{r}
#| label: 08-making-tidy-easier-32a

stmf_country_years <- function(df = stmf) {

  df |>
    dplyr::select(cname, year) |>

    dplyr::mutate(dplyr::across(where(is.character), \(x) dplyr::recode(x, .missing = "-"))) |>
    dplyr::arrange(cname)

# How Projects Grow

## Like Topsy

## Like Topsy

![](../assets/12-build/12_covdata_package.png)

## Controlling this

- As projects grow, you will want to _refactor_ them
- Think in terms of modular code and invidivually isolatable steps
- These things tend to go in a predictable sequence

## For instance

- Some scripts, or a single notebook, becomes ...
- One script (or notebook) to rule them all, becomes ...
- A coordinating script to rule them all, becomes ...
- A function to rule them all, becomes ...
- A series of functions to rule them all, becomes ...
- A package to rule them all, becomes ...
- A modular set of packages


## Make
- Quarto can take care of a lot (and often all) of the process of building a
paper or book, making sure all of the code needed to create it gets run, and
all of the tables and figures are properly labeled and cross-referenced, etc.
- But if your project is more complex, the `qmd` part
will depend on R scripts that do data cleaning, analysis, and figure/table
generation.
- You can use `Makefile`s to manage these dependencies.
- Example: <https://github.com/kjhealy/make_example>

## Did you say "Dependencies"?

![](../assets/12-build/12_mptc_dag.png)

Everything is a DAG now.

## Targets

Make for R: <https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/>

Comes with a very thorough manual: <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/>

## renv and Build Environments

<https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html>

![](../assets/12-build/12_renv.png)

You check-in the _lockfile_ to your project, but not the actual packages.

# R Packages

## For functionality, data, and papers

- Consider packaging your datasets! Benefits to documentation/codebooks etc
- One-table example: [nyczips](https://kjhealy.github.io/nyczips/)
- More extensive: [covdata](https://kjhealy.github.io/covdata/), [gssr](https://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/)
- How R packages work: [Wickham & Bryan](https://r-pkgs.org)
