[Moar Data]{.fg-orange}
:::

## More than one data file

- Inside `files/examples/` is a folder named `congress/`

::: {.smallcode}

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-3"
# A little trick from the fs package: 
fs::dir_tree(here("files", "examples", "congress"))
```

:::

## More than one data file

Let's look at one.

::: {.smallcode}

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-4"
read_csv(here("files", "examples", "congress", "17_95_congress.csv")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  head()
```

:::

We often find ourselves in this situation. We know each file has the same structure, and we would like to use them all at once. 

## Loops?

How to read them all in?

One traditional way, which we could do in R, is to write an explicit _loop_ that iterated over a vector of filenames, read each file, and then joined the results together in a tall rectangle.

```r
# Pseudocode

filenames <- c("01_79_congress.csv", "02_80_congress.csv", "03_81_congress.csv",
                "04_82_congress.csv" [etc etc])

collected_files <- NULL

for(i in 1:length(filenames)) {
      new_file <- read_file(filenames[i])
      collected_files <- append_to(collected_files, new_files)
}


```

## Loops?

::: {.incremental}
- You may have noticed we have not written any loops, however.
- While loops are still lurking there underneath the surface, what we will do instead is to take advantage of the combination of vectors and functions and _map_ one to the other in order to generate results.
- Speaking loosely, think of [**`map()`**]{.fg-green} as a way of [iterating]{.fg-orange} without writing loops. You start with a vector of things. You feed it one thing at a time to some function. The function does whatever it does. You get back output that is the same length as your input, and of a specific type.
:::


## Mapping is just a kind of iteration

::: {.incremental}
- The `purrr` package provides a big family of mapping functions. One reason there are a lot of them is that `purrr`, like the rest of the tidyverse, is picky about data types. 
- So in addition to the basic [**`map()`**]{.fg-green}, which always returns a _list_, we also have [**`map_chr()`**]{.fg-green}, [**`map_int()`**]{.fg-green}, [**`map_dbl()`**]{.fg-green}, [**`map_lgl()`**]{.fg-green} and others. They always return the data type indicated by their suffix, or die trying.
:::

## Vectorized arithmetic again

The simplest cases are not that different from the vectorized arithmetic we're already familiar with. 

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-5"
a <- c(1:10)

b <- 1

# You know what R will do here
a + b

```

::::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
R's vectorized rules add `b` to every element of `a`. In a sense, the [**`+`**]{.fg-green} operation can be thought of as a function that takes each element of `a` and does something with it. In this case "add `b`".      
:::::


## Vectorized arithmetic again

We can make this explicit by writing a function:

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-6"
add_b <- function(x) {
  b <- 1
  x + b # for any x
}
```


## Vectorized arithmetic again

We can make this explicit by writing a function:

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-6b"
add_b <- function(x) {
  b <- 1
  x + b # for any x
}
```


Now:

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-7"
add_b(x = a)
```

## Vectorized arithmetic again

Again, R's vectorized approach means it automatically adds `b` to every element of the x we give it.

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-8"
add_b(x = 10)
```

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-9"
add_b(x = c(1, 99, 1000))
```

## [Iterating]{.fg-green} in a pipeline

Some operations can't directly be vectorized in this way, which is why we need to manually iterate, or will want to write loops. 

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-10"
library(gapminder)
gapminder |> 
  summarize(country_n = n_distinct(country), 
            continent_n = n_distinct(continent), 
            year_n = n_distinct(year), 
            lifeExp_n = n_distinct(lifeExp), 
            population_n = n_distinct(population))
```

That's tedious to write! Computers are supposed to allow us to avoid that sort of thing.

## [Iterating]{.fg-green} in a pipeline

So how would we iterate this? What we want is to apply the [**`n_distinct()`**]{.fg-green} function to each column of `gapminder`, but in a way that still allows us to use pipelines and so on. 

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-11"
library(gapminder)
gapminder |> 
  summarize(n_distinct(country), 
            n_distinct(continent), 
            n_distinct(year), 
            n_distinct(lifeExp), 
            n_distinct(population))
```

::: aside
Using [**`n_distinct()`**]{.fg-green} in this context is an idea I got from Rebecca Barter's discussion of `purrr`.
:::

## [Iterating]{.fg-green} in a pipeline

You'd use [**across()**]{.fg-green}, like this:

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-12"
gapminder |> 
  summarize(across(everything(), n_distinct))
```

## [Iterating]{.fg-green} in a pipeline

But you could also do this ... 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-13"
  map(gapminder, n_distinct)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%" .right}
- Read it as "Feed each column of `gapminder` to the [**`n_distinct()`**]{.fg-green} function.
- (This is pretty much what [**`across()`**]{.fg-green} is doing more nicely.)
:::
::::

## [Iterating]{.fg-green} in a pipeline

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Or, in pipeline form:

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-14"
gapminder |> 
  map(n_distinct)
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%" .right}

You can see we are getting a _list_ back.

## [Iterating]{.fg-green} in a pipeline

Or, in pipeline form:

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-15"
result <- gapminder |> 
  map(n_distinct)

class(result)

result$continent

result[[2]]
```


## [Iterating]{.fg-green} in a pipeline

But we know [**`n_distinct()`**]{.fg-green} should always return an integer. So we use [**`map_int()`**]{.fg-green} instead of the generic [**`map()`**]{.fg-green}.


```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-16"
gapminder |> 
  map_int(n_distinct)
```

::::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
The thing about the [**`map()`**]{.fg-green} family is that they can deal with all kinds of input types and output types.    
:::::



## Get a vector of [filenames]{.fg-pink}

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-17"
filenames <- dir(path = here("files", "examples", "congress"),
                 pattern = "*.csv",
                 full.names = TRUE)

filenames[1:15] # Just displaying the first 15, to save slide space

```

## And feed it to [`read_csv()`]{.fg-green}

... using [**`map()`**]{.fg-green} and binding the resulting list into a tibble.

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-18"
df <- filenames |> 
  map(read_csv) |> #<<
  list_rbind(names_to = "congress") |> 
  janitor::clean_names()

df
```

---

![](../assets/08-iterate/emperor-witness.png)

## [`read_csv()`]{.fg-green} can do this directly

In fact `map()` is not required for this particular use:

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-19"
tmp <- read_csv(filenames, id = "path",
                name_repair = janitor::make_clean_names)

tmp |> 
  mutate(congress = stringr::str_extract(path, "_\\d{2,3}_congress"), 
         congress = stringr::str_extract(congress, "\\d{2,3}")) |> 
  relocate(congress)

```

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-21"
#| message: FALSE
#| results: "hide"
out <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
                    variables = "B19013_001",
                    state = "NY", 
                    county = "New York", 
                    survey = "acs1",
                    year = 2005)
```

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-22"
out
```

## Iterating on the [U.S. Census]{.fg-yellow}

All counties in New York State for a specific year

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-23"
#| message: FALSE
#| results: "hide"
out <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
                    variables = "B19013_001",
                    state = "NY", 
                    survey = "acs1",
                    year = 2005)
```

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-24"
out
```

## Iterating on the [U.S. Census]{.fg-yellow}

What if we want the results for _every_ available year?
First, a handy function: [**`set_names()`**]{.fg-green}

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-25 07-iterating-on-census-3"
x <- c(1:10)

x

x <- set_names(x, nm = letters[1:10])

x
```

## Iterating on the [U.S. Census]{.fg-yellow}

By default, [**`set_names()`**]{.fg-green} will label a vector with that vector’s values:

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-26 07-iterating-on-census-4"
c(1:10) |> 
  set_names()

```

## Iterating on the [U.S. Census]{.fg-yellow}

This works with `map()` just fine:

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-27"
#| message: FALSE
#| results: "hide"
df <- 2005:2019 |> 
  map(\(x) get_acs(geography = "county",
                   variables = "B19013_001",
                   state = "NY",
                   survey = "acs1",
                   year = x)) |> 
  list_rbind(names_to = "year") 
```

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-28"
df
```

## Iterating on the [U.S. Census]{.fg-yellow}

Our `id` column *tracks* the year. But we’d like it to *be* the year. So,
we use [**`set_names()`**]{.fg-green}:


```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-29"
#| message: FALSE
#| results: "hide"
df <- 2005:2019 |> 
  set_names() |> 
  map(\(x) get_acs(geography = "county",
                   variables = "B19013_001",
                   state = "NY",
                   survey = "acs1",
                   year = x)) |> 
  list_rbind(names_to = "year") |>
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

## Iterating on the [U.S. Census]{.fg-yellow}

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-30"
df
```


Now `year` is just the year. The `year` column will be created as a
character vector, so we converted it back to an integer again at the end.

```{r}
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-31"

                   survey = "acs1",
                   year = x)) |>

# Wrangling [Models]{.fg-green}

## This is not a [statistics]{.fg-yellow} seminar!

- I'll just give you an example of the sort of thing that many other modeling packages implement for all kinds of modeling techniques.
- Again, the principle is tidy incorporation of models and their output.

## Tidy regression output with [broom]{.fg-yellow}

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-61"
library(broom)
library(gapminder)
```


```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-2"
out <- lm(formula = lifeExp ~ gdpPercap + pop + continent,
          data = gapminder)
```

## Tidy regression output with [broom]{.fg-yellow}

We can't _do_ anything with this, programatically.

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-3"
summary(out)
```

## Tidy regression output with [broom]{.fg-yellow}

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-8"
library(broom)
```

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-9"
tidy(out)
```

That's a _lot_ nicer. Now it's just a tibble. We know those.

## Tidy regression output with [broom]{.fg-yellow}

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-11"
out_conf <- tidy(out, conf.int = TRUE)
out_conf 
```

## Tidy regression output with [broom]{.fg-yellow}

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-62"
out_conf |>
    filter(term %nin% "(Intercept)") |>
    mutate(nicelabs = prefix_strip(term, "continent")) |>
    select(nicelabs, everything())
```

## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-20"
eu77 <- gapminder |> filter(continent == "Europe", year == 1977)
fit <- lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = eu77)
```


```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-21"

summary(fit)
```

## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-22"

out_le <- gapminder |>
    group_by(continent, year) |>
    nest()

out_le

```

Think of nesting as a kind of "super-grouping". Look in the object inspector.

## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}

It's still in there.

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-23"
out_le |> filter(continent == "Europe" & year == 1977) |> 
    unnest(cols = c(data))
```

## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-24"
#| echo: FALSE
old_digits <- getOption("digits")
options(digits = 3)
```

Here we [**`map()`**]{.fg-green} a custom function to every row in the `data` column.

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-25"

fit_ols <- function(df) {
    lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = df)
}

out_le <- gapminder |>
    group_by(continent, year) |>
    nest() |> 
    mutate(model = map(data, fit_ols)) #<<
```

## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}


```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-63"
out_le
```


## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}

We can tidy the nested models, too.

```{r}
#| label: "r 07-[Iterating]{.fg-green}-26"

fit_ols <- function(df) {
    lm(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), data = df)
}

out_tidy <- gapminder |>
    group_by(continent, year) |>
    nest() |> 
    mutate(model = map(data, fit_ols),
           tidied = map(model, tidy)) |>
    unnest(cols = c(tidied)) |>
    filter(term %nin% "(Intercept)" &
           continent %nin% "Oceania")
```


## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-64"
out_tidy
```

## Grouped analysis and [list columns]{.fg-orange}

```{r }
#| label: "07-iterating-on-data-65"
out_tidy |> 
    ungroup() |>
    sample_n(5)
```

# Midwest PCA Example

## Midwest data

```{r}
midwest
```

## Extract numeric vars

```{r}
mw_pca <- midwest |>
    group_by(state) |>
    select(where(is.numeric)) |>
    select(-PID)
    
mw_pca
```

## PCA Helper function

We could do this anonymously too.

```{r}
do_pca <- function(df){
  prcomp(df,
         center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
}
```

## PCA on the whole dataset

```{r}
out_pca <- mw_pca |>
    ungroup() |>
    select(-state) |>
    do_pca()

out_pca
```

## Tidier view

```{r}
tidy_pca <- tidy(out_pca, matrix = "pcs")

tidy_pca

```

## Using `augment()`

This puts the original data points back in.

```{r}
aug_pca <- augment(out_pca, data = mw_pca[,-1])
aug_pca <-  aug_pca |> 
  tibble::add_column(midwest$state, midwest$county, .before = TRUE) |>
  rename(state = `midwest$state`, county = `midwest$county`)

aug_pca
```

## Grouped PCA

Let's do that grouped by State

```{r}
mw_pca <- mw_pca |>
    group_by(state) |>
    nest()

mw_pca
```

## Grouped PCA


```{r}
state_pca <- mw_pca |> 
    mutate(pca = map(data, do_pca))

state_pca

```

## Grouped PCA

Alternatively, write a lambda function:

```{r}
mw_pca |> 
    mutate(pca = map(data, \(x) prcomp(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)))
```


## Tidy it

```{r}
do_tidy <- function(pr){
    broom::tidy(pr, matrix = "pcs")
}

state_pca  <- mw_pca |>
    mutate(pca = map(data, do_pca),
           pcs = map(pca, do_tidy)) 

state_pca
```

## Tidy it

Or again, write a lambda function

```{r}
mw_pca |>
    mutate(pca = map(data, \(x) prcomp(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
           pcs = map(pca, \(x) tidy(x, matrix = "pcs")))
```


## Unnest to inspect

::: {.smallcode}

```{r}
mw_pca |>
  mutate(pca = map(data, \(x) prcomp(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
           pcs = map(pca, \(x) tidy(x, matrix = "pcs"))) |> 
  unnest(cols = c(pcs)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = PC, y = percent)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.1) +
  facet_wrap(~ state, nrow = 1) +
  labs(x = "Principal Component",
       y = "Variance Explained") 
```

:::

## And finally, `augment()`

```{r}
do_aug <- function(pr){
    broom::augment(pr)
}


state_pca  <- mw_pca |>
    mutate(pca = map(data, do_pca),
           pcs = map(pca, do_tidy),
           fitted = map(pca, do_aug)) 

state_pca
```


## ... or a lambda

```{r}
mw_pca |>
  mutate(pca = map(data, \(x) prcomp(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
         pcs = map(pca, \(x) tidy(x, matrix = "pcs")), 
         fitted = map(pca, \(x) augment(x)))
```


## In one breath

```{r}
out <- midwest |>
    group_by(state) |>
    select_if(is.numeric) |>
    select(-PID) |>
    nest() |>
    mutate(pca = map(data, \(x) prcomp(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
           pcs = map(pca, \(x) tidy(x, matrix = "pcs")), 
           fitted = map(pca, \(x) augment(x))) |>
    unnest(cols = c(fitted)) |>
    add_column(county = midwest$county) 

out
```



---

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

ggplot(data = out, aes(x = .fittedPC1,
               y = .fittedPC2,
               label = county)) +
    geom_text(size = 1.1) +
    labs(x = "First Principal Component", 
         y = "Second Principal Component") +
    theme_minimal() + facet_wrap(~ state, ncol = 2)

::: {.notes}
What are these? `sdev` contains the standard deviations of the principal components. `rotation` is a matrix where the rows correspond to the columns of the original data, and the columns are the principal components. `x` is a matrix containing the value of the rotated data multiplied by the `rotation` matrix. Finally, `center` and `scale` are vectors showing the centering and scaling for each observation. 

Now, to get from this information back to the original data matrix, we need to multiply `x` by the transpose of the `rotation` matrix, and then revert the centering and scaling steps. If we multiply by the transpose of the _full_ rotation matrix (and then un-center and un-scale), we'll recover the original data matrix exactly. But we can also choose to use just the first few principal components, instead. There are 633 components in all (corresponding to the number of rows in the original data matrix), but the scree plot suggests that most of the data is "explained" by a much smaller number of components than that. 

Here's a function that takes a PCA object created by `prcomp()` and returns an approximation of the original data, calculated by some number (`n_comp`) of principal components. It returns its results in long format, in a way that mirrors what the Imager library wants. This will make plotting easier in a minute.
