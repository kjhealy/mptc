## Set up a project

Some of the [example material from last week](/example/06-example.html) might be usefule for the GitHub part of this assignment.

Either with your own data or with one of the [sample data sources](https://mptc.io/content/), do the following: 

1. Create a project in RStudio and initialize a git repository in it. 

2. Add your chosen data to the project.

3. Add a Quarto file or R script that will be where you start reading in and cleaning the data. 

4. Push the project to a repository on GitHub (either public or private). 

5. Once you've done the reading for this week, see if you can read in the data to R and start exploring it.
