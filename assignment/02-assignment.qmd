## Complete parts One to Four of the Carpentries' Shell Tutorial

- [Click here to access the tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html). It has seven parts, which you're welcome to do all of, but for now you should do at least the first four: Introducing the Shell, Navigating Files and Directories, Working with Files and Directories, and Pipes and Filters. 

- Don't skip the Summary and Setup section! Amongst other things it has a zip file of sample material you will need to download in order to complete the tutorial. 

- If you are on Windows, remember to _explicitly_ uncompress or expand the zip file you download before trying to use anything in it. 

- Complete the exercises in the Tutorial (don't just read through them!) and make notes of any questions you want to raise in class about it.
