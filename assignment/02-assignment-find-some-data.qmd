There is no class this week, because of the Labor Day holiday. However, there is an assignment due on Friday, September 5.

## Task 1: Data Sources

Look at the [list of practice data sources](https://mptc.io/content/) on the course website. Pick one of the data sources. Alternatively, find a similar source for yourself that you are interested in. From there, choose one table from that source and download the data to your computer.

## Task 2: Set up a Project

Set up a new R project in RStudio, and save the data file in a subdirectory of that project named `data`. Create a new Quarto document in the project, and write a short paragraph about the data you downloaded, saying what format you think it is in, what it contains, and what you think you could learn from it.

## Task 3: Submit Your Work

Compress or zip-up the entire project directory and submit it to the Assignment drop box on Canvas.

To do this on Mac OS, in the Finder, select the folder, right click (that is, hold down the Control key and click), and choose "Compress".

```{r zip-mac, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets", "00-site", "compress-mac-1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

On Windows, Locate the file or folder that you want to zip. Press and hold (or right-click) the file or folder, select (or point to) Send to, and then select Compressed (zipped) folder. A new zipped folder with the same name is created in the same location.

```{r zip-windows, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets", "00-site", "compress-windows.png"), error = FALSE)
```
