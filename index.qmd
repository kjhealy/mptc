# What we'll cover

We have twelve class weeks for this seminar, excluding Labor Day and Fall Break. During that time we will learn some elements of plain-text computing that every graduate student in the social sciences (and beyond!) should know something about. They are shown in @tbl-schedule.

{{< include _weekly-schedule.qmd >}}

Consult the [course schedule page](/schedule/) for more detail on weekly topics, readings, and assignments. The [syllabus](/syllabus/) has more information on expectations, requirements, course polices, and assessment for the seminar.
