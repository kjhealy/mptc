This section contains worked examples related to what we've been covering. Material for specific weeks can be accessed via the menu to the left. In the examples, you will see both chunks of code and the output the code produces. For instance here are some shell commands:

```{zsh}
ls
```

The command comes first, the output comes second. 

```{zsh}
ls | wc -l
```


You can copy the code used in these examples in one of two ways. First, you can mouse over any code chunk and click the clipboard icon, {{< fa clipboard >}}, that appears. 

Second, you can scroll to the top of your screen. You will see "</> Code" written in gray in the right corner. If you click that, you will get a little menu that allows you to hide or show all the code chunks on an example page, and also copy the code for the entire page.
