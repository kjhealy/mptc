This section contains worked examples related to what we've been covering. Material for specific weeks can be accessed via the menu. In the examples, you will see both chunks of code and the output the code produces. For instance here are some shell commands:

```{zsh}
# The absolute path where this project lives on my Mac
pwd
```


```{zsh}
# The directory listing for the top-level folder of this project
ls
```


```{zsh}
# Listing all and only the qmd files at theÂ project's top-level folder
ls *.qmd
```


The command comes first, the output comes second. 

```{zsh}
# Get a count of the number of lines in all the qmd files in the root folder 
wc -l *.qmd
```


```{zsh}
# Get a count (separately) of the number of lines in every file in the slides folder 
find ./slides -name '*.qmd' | xargs wc -l 
```



You can copy the code used in these examples in one of two ways. First, you can mouse over any code chunk and click the clipboard icon, {{< fa clipboard >}}, that appears. 

Second, you can scroll to the top of your screen. You will see "</> Code" written in gray in the right corner. If you click that, you will get a little menu that allows you to hide or show all the code chunks on an example page, and also copy the code for the entire page.
