On a Mac or Linux system, or on Windows with the WSL or Cygwin installed, try some commands:


### Who are you?

```{zsh}
whoami
```


### Where in the filesystem are you right now?

```{zsh}
pwd
```

### File listing

```{zsh}
ls
```


### File listing with switches

`l` for long form, `t` for order by last modified, `h` for show sizes in human-readable units.

```{zsh}
ls -lth
```


### Piping output

```{zsh}
ls | wc -l
```


### The file system structure

```{zsh}
# Show the directory structure (excluding files) for this project
# up to three levels deep. Your version of tree may need a lower-case
# d for the -D switch: tree -d -L 3 
tree -D -L 3
```


### Moving around

```{zsh}
## Enter a directory
cd files
ls
```

```{zsh}
## Move up to parent directory
cd ..
ls
```

```{zsh}
## Move directly to top of home directory
cd ~
```

```{zsh}
## Move back to the previous directory, wherever that was
cd - 
ls
```

```{zsh}
## Move down a path relative to where you are now
cd files/bib
ls
```

```{zsh}
## Move down then back up two levels
cd files/bib
cd ../../
ls
```
