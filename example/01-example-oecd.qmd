1. First version of our tiny paper: [Click here (PDF)](/files/examples/01_mptc_oecd_nocode.pdf)

2. Second version of our tiny paper: [Click here (PDF)](/files/examples/01_mptc_oecd_withcode.pdf)

3. Take a look at the project on GitHub: <https://github.com/kjhealy/mptc_oecd>

4. Get the `mptc_oecd` project onto your computer, either by (a) Downloading it as a ZIP file from GitHub and unzipping it, or (b) by cloning it with Git. Either is fine, but (b) is better if you can do it.

5. Open the project in RStudio. See if you can render the `mptc_oecd.qmd` file to HTML or PDF.
